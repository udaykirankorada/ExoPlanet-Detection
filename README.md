# ExoPlanet-Detection

## Introduction
Detection of exoplanets is an important step in understanding the expanse of life forms across solar systems different from ours. In this project, we use open-source data available from the Kepler Space Telescope (KST) and machine learning methods to detect exoplanets.

## Methodology
The idea is to plot the intensities of different stars at different times. When the transit curve is plotted, we expect an intensity drop whenever the exoplanet makes a transit. The data is filtered and trained using ML for predicting whether a given time series data belongs to an exoplanet system or not.

## Working
Basic Python libraries are used
